                                    This application would use Google's Civic API, Propublica's API, and a web scraper to collect information from the VoteSmart.org website. The user would be prompted for their
                                    location and then displayed a list of all the candidates that are running for office in their local, state, and national races. Once they selected a race
                                    information about the candidates would be displayed.<br/>
                                    The intent was to make this as an Android app, but due to the limited time frame we were unable to get past the data collection portion of the process.
